## Overview

This project is an end-to-end Voice of Customer (VoC) Intelligence Platform that analyzes Reddit community discussions and converts unstructured conversations into structured product insights.

The system processes thousands of discussions, identifies conversations containing product feedback, extracts actionable insights using a local Large Language Model (LLM), normalizes recurring themes, and visualizes results through an interactive analytics dashboard.

The project demonstrates:

* LLM Engineering
* Prompt Engineering
* Data Processing Pipelines
* NLP-based Insight Extraction
* Product Analytics
* Dashboard Development
* Local AI Deployment using Ollama

---

## Problem Statement

Online communities contain valuable customer feedback, but extracting meaningful insights manually is time-consuming and difficult.

Product teams need answers to questions such as:

* What problems are users experiencing?
* What features do customers want?
* What benefits do users appreciate?
* Which user personas are most active?
* Which issues occur most frequently?

This project automates the process of converting community discussions into structured product intelligence.

## Pipeline

### 1. Discussion Grouping

Raw Reddit comments are grouped into discussion-level records.

Generated Metrics:

* Comment Count
* Average Score
* Maximum Score
* Discussion Metadata

Output:

```text
discussions.pkl
```

---

### 2. Discussion Classification

A local LLM classifies each discussion into categories:

* Complaint
* Praise
* Feature Request
* Buying Advice
* Technical Support
* Showcase
* Humor / Meme
* Community Discussion

Additional outputs:

* Contains Product Insights
* Confidence Score
* Classification Reason

Output:

```text
classified_discussions.pkl
```

---

### 3. Product Insight Extraction

The LLM extracts only explicitly discussed information.

Extracted Categories:

* Pain Points
* Gains
* Personas
* Must-Have Features
* Nice-To-Have Features
* Feature Requests

Design Goals:

* No hallucinations
* JSON-only responses
* Explicit evidence extraction
* Conservative output generation

Output:

```text
discussion_insights.pkl
```

---

### 4. Theme Normalization

Similar insights are merged into standardized themes.

Example:

```text
Bluetooth Issues
Bluetooth Connectivity Problems
Bluetooth Reliability Problems

↓
Bluetooth Reliability
```

Output:

```text
normalized_insights.pkl
```

---

### 5. Insight Aggregation

Normalized insights are aggregated to identify:

* Most Common Pain Points
* Most Requested Features
* Top User Personas
* Most Appreciated Benefits

---

## LLM Evaluation

Multiple local models were evaluated before selecting the final production model.

| Model       | Result   |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Gemma 3 4B  | Rejected |
| Qwen 3 8B   | Rejected |
| Qwen 2.5 7B | Selected |

### Selection Criteria

* JSON Reliability
* Schema Compliance
* Hallucination Rate
* Prompt Controllability
* Extraction Accuracy

### Final Choice

**Qwen 2.5 7B via Ollama**

Reasons:

* Consistent structured outputs
* Strong schema adherence
* Lower hallucination rate
* Reliable extraction behavior
