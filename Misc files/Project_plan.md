- Extracts:
  - Pain Points
  - Gains
  - Personas
  - Must-Have Features
  - Nice-To-Have Features
  - Feature Requests
- Normalizes themes
- Aggregates insights
- Displays results in an interactive dashboard

Goal:

Convert unstructured community discussions into actionable product intelligence.

# 14. Elevator Pitch

Built a Voice of Customer ai Intelligence Platform that analyzes 9,042 Reddit comments from the Mechanical Keyboards community using a local LLM (Qwen 2.5 7B via Ollama). The system classifies discussions, extracts product insights, normalizes themes, and visualizes pain points, gains, personas, and feature requests through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
